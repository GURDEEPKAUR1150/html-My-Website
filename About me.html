</head>
<body>
<p>Hello, I'm Gurdeep Kaur, and I'd like to share my journey from a seasoned banker to an aspiring coder. My professional voyage has been nothing short of a remarkable adventure, filled with growth, challenges, and learning experiences.</p>
<h2>A Banking Odyssey</h2>
<p>I embarked on my professional journey with the State Bank of India in 1994, serving as a humble clerk-cum-cashier. Over the years, I navigated the dynamic landscape of banking, climbing the ladder through numerous promotions, and ultimately attaining the prestigious position of Chief Manager. This incredible journey allowed me to accumulate extensive experience in managing branches, where I oversaw a substantial business portfolio, valued at around 250 crores, for an impressive eight years.</p>
<p>My educational journey was equally diverse, having earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Delhi University and a Bachelor of Education degree from Annamalai University. Initially, my career path led me to the world of education, where I spent two fulfilling years as a teacher before transitioning into the realm of banking.</p>
<h2>Embracing Change</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, life is a series of chapters, and one must always be prepared for new beginnings. Recently, I found myself at a crossroads, leading to yet another pivotal moment in my career. With a blend of curiosity and determination, I made the bold decision to bid farewell to the world of banking and embark on a new adventureâ€”coding.</p>
<h2>The Coding Frontier</h2>
<p>My current pursuit revolves around the fascinating world of coding. I have embraced the challenges and rewards that come with learning this versatile skill. The logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and creativity required in coding have captivated my interest. As I delve deeper into this realm, I am excited to explore the limitless possibilities that coding offers.</p>
<p>This transition signifies more than just a change in career; it's a testament to my unyielding spirit of curiosity and growth. My journey from banking to coding exemplifies the idea that it's never too late to follow your passion and explore new horizons.</p>
<p>I am thrilled about what the future holds and eager to embrace the opportunities and challenges that come with it. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to contributing my skills, knowledge, and experiences to the vibrant coding community.</p>
<p><h4>Thank you for joining me on this transformative journey, and I invite you to connect with me as I embark on this exciting chapter of my life.
